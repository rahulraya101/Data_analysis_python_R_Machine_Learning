Such a “name-to-object” mapping allows us to access an object by a name that we’ve assigned to it. E.g., if we make a simple string assignment via `a_string = \"Hello string\"`, we created a reference to the `\"Hello string\"` object, and henceforth we can access via its variable name `a_string`.\n",
