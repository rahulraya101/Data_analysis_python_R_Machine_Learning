    "# Couse of R language syntax\n",
    "## © Vojtech Janousek 2016–2020\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we give an overview of the syntax and basic usage of the R language. We describe how to start and stop an R session, obtain help and find documentation. An account of the main object types and their manipulation in direct (i.e. command line) mode is followed by text on arguably the strongest point—graphics. The short course is closed by a section on writing true R programs (batch mode). \n",
    "\n",
    "The text is largely adopted from Appendix A to the monograph on R modelling by Janoušek et al. (2016) that is, in turn, partly based on the pdf manual *An Introduction to R*, available from the `Help` menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the help system and pdf manuals included with the R distribution, the reader can find additional information in an increasing number of books and web sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, information concerning the current state of the R project, binaries, source codes and documentation are obtainable from the R project website (http://www.r-project.org) and the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) (http://cran.r-project.org). CRAN, which is mirrored at many servers worldwide, also provides a distribution channel for user-contributed packages that add new functionality to the core of the R system.\n",
